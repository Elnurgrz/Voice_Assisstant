# Voice_Assisstant
This project is about creating a voice-activated assistant, similar to Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant, but using Mistral AI's large language model (LLM) for understanding and responding to user commands. The assistant can understand spoken commands, perform various tasks, and engage in conversations in multiple languages.
